run clicker.py

It expects the game to be played in windowed mode with a window size of 1662, 942. It will print how close you are to the right size until you achieve it.

Features:
 Can click the fruit/clickables/headcrabs whatevers for rubies without missing
 Can execute the dark ritual combo (all skills are tracked)
 Can identify all available heroes
 Can scroll to and purchase either set increments (1/10/25/100) of any hero or up to any amount
 Can turn progression mode on if its turned off. tracks every hero's skill level when it gets turned off (allows for simple 25 level comparisons)
 Can click the buy all skills button on demand
 Can track souls and calculate peak souls per minute
 Can do a clickable based ascension

Yet to implement:
 Ascending without a clickable.
 Info tracking between script runs (export to csv or something)

Refactoring needed:
 Remove all hardcoded integer based offsets, allow for "dynamic" ones based off user settings

Long term plans:
 GUI control and stats panel
 package script as exe with all needed libraries and stuff

Even Longer term plans:
 Intermediary JSON/XML based orders setup, build an equivalent "not_as_dumb_buy" function completely from that.
 Build a GUI editor for said JSON/XML datapacket
